“Don’t count the days. Make the days count.” – Muhammad Ali

This quote by Muhammad Ali has been a major source of encouragement during my Ruby CLI Project journey. I had hoped to complete the project within the span of two weeks, but because of unforeseen life circumstances, it took me about 3 weeks.

The project had a lot of moving parts. Once I read over all of the requirements, I knew that I needed something to help me monitor my progress and stay organized. I came across free online task and project management software through [nTask](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/). This platform was a life saver! I was able to list each of the project’s requirements, break each one down into executable tasks, assign due dates (and adjust them as needed), and mark each one complete as I finished them. 

I knew that I wanted my CLI project to be something that I could actually benefit from. There has been a lot of buzz around essential oils and I did not know much about them when I started the project. I ultimately decided to base the project on essential oils and I found a great website by [Aura Casia](https://www.auracacia.com/community/essential-oil-must-haves) that listed different types of oils, along with their descriptions, benefits, aromas, uses, and even helpful recipes and tips for using them. 


For me, the most challenging part of the project was actually scraping the website. It took a lot of patience and even more Googling to choose the accurate CSS selectors that would obtain the data in the format I needed it. One great CSS selector resource I found was by [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).

I would advise anyone who is about to undertake this project to pay close attention to each of the instructional videos that are listed with the assignment. They include excellent “knowledge gems” that are not included in the regular lesson text. 

You can find my gem code at my public GitHub repo : https://github.com/NNWaller/essential_oil_central. You can also view my walkthrough of the project on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/1jzktKdnjuA).
