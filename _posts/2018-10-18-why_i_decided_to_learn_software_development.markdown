Carl Bard said, “Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.” These words eloquently sum up how I feel about pursuing a career as a software engineer/web developer. In March of 2018,  I was able to participate in a pilot for testing a new application that would assist my employer with managing data for insurance claims. This project allowed me to collaborate with representatives from other states as we shared our input with the developers about what features could help make the application easier to use. My participation in this project sparked my interest in becoming even more involved in helping to develop similar tools to streamline our customer interactions. However, I knew that I lacked the necessary skills to become a software engineer. 

In the past, I shied away from the field of technology. I did not feel that I would be able to grasp the concepts because I have been outrageously math averse. I kept hearing reports about how the tech scene and software engineering jobs in my city (Atlanta, GA) were growing by leaps and bounds, so I decided to try out a few free online coding resources to see if I could understand it. I started off learning JavaScript and, to my surprise, it was not as heavily math-based as I thought! I actually enjoyed solving different coding challenges. 

I soon began to research multiple software engineering bootcamp programs, which ultimately led me to Flatiron School. I read various testimonials from Flatiron bootcamp graduates, reviewed their student outcomes report, and completed several lessons in the Bootcamp Prep. My experience with the Bootcamp Prep helped me to gain the courage to apply to the Community Powered Bootcamp program. I decided upon this path because of its well-rounded curriculum and flexibility (I am a mother of a toddler).

So far, things are going very well! Flatiron has recently started a hub here in Atlanta and I am excited about connecting with more local students and visiting the campus which will be unveiled in November 2018.
